File | Goal
---|---
0-malloc_checked.c | Allocate memory using `malloc`. Return a pointer to the allocated memory.
1-string_nconcat.c | Concatenate two strings. Return a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory. If the function fails, return NULL. If NULL is passed, treat as an empty string
2-calloc.c | Allocate memory for an array using `malloc`. The memory is set to zero.
3-array_range.c | Create an array of integers. Return a pointer to the newly created array
